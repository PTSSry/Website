## Common Saunas
[Teekkarikyl√§ common sauna shifts](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=jpv0nr25o8389bl3mao4q3hb9s%40group.calendar.google.com) calendar includes all common sauna shifts of AYY and HOAS. Access to saunas usually requires a key, a door code, or both. [Telegram](https://t.me/PTSSry) can be used to ask other people who want to go to sauna or to open the sauna door.

You can book your own shift to public saunas from [AYY domo](https://domo.ayy.fi/buildings) and [HOAS booking](https://booking.hoas.fi/).
