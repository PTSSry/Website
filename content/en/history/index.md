## General
Polytechnic Sauna Society (abbreviation PTSS) is a student association operating within the Aalto University Student Union. Its purpose is to unite Aalto University students interested in sauna and sauna culture and to promote knowledge of sauna cultures and to nurture the sauna traditions of the Otaniemi campus.

The activities of the association focus specifically on sauna and its effect on promoting well-being and uniting people. The activities of the association include the organization of events and visits related to saunas and the provision of information related to saunas and saunas. In addition, the association has tried to actively cooperate with other sauna operators.

## Establishment
The Polytechnic Sauna Society was born, as you might guess, on sauna benches in Otaniemi Teekkarikylä. The idea of ​​founding an association came from the need for a club focusing on saunas and the lack of one. The name of the association, or really its acronym PTSS, came to mind from the sound produced by the steam thrown into the stove. The joke sounded so good at the time that it had to be done. We lived in the spring of 2018, when the founding members really started to thwart the association in the aftermath. The rules and other bureaucracy associated with the establishment were quickly set in motion and moved on, although once upon a time there was hesitation as to whether the idea was still so good. However, new enthusiasts of the idea were brought in and eventually the wheel started rolling so hard that it could no longer retreat.

The founding meeting of the Polytechnic Sauna Association was held at Helsinki Railway Square on the day of the Finnish sauna on June 9, 2018. The meeting was part of the Sauna Day event organized by the Finnish Sauna Association. The founding members were Ville Alasalmi, Severi Mattila, Veeti Paju and Iiro Vainikainen. After the founding meeting, the new association was registered with the National Board of Patents and Registration and listed as an association operating within the Aalto University Student Union (AYY). The first eight-member board was also elected for the association, which included four other people in addition to the founding members. At the end of summer 2018, the association was officially established and operational.

Since its establishment, Polyteknikkojen Saunaseura has gradually sought to consolidate its operations, connect with other sauna operators and gain more members. The club has been on display for students during both the autumn and spring orientation weeks and has organized sauna evenings and visits to public saunas. The first election meeting of the club was held to get acquainted with the sauna facilities of Sokos Hotel Tapiola Garden, where the following actors were selected for the sauna benches. Since then, the association has continued its life.
