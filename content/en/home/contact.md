You can apply for membership by filling in the form below: Fill in the **name** and **e-mail** fields and write **I am applying for PTSS membership**, **your place of residence** and **whether you are a member of AYY** in the message field.

Only members of Aalto University Student Union (AYY) will have a voting right in the association meetings.

New members can be accepted in a meeting of the board of PTSS. An applying member needs to introduce oneself in the meeting or to a board member before-hand. 

Accepted new members will be sent a confirmation and instructions to pay the membership fee (5â‚¬). New members will also be added to the PTSS mailing list.
