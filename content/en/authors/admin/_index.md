Do you need a sauna company in Otaniemi?

The Polytechnic Sauna Society, or more familiarly PTSS, is a student sauna association that operates on the Aalto University campus in Otaniemi. The purpose of the association is to bring together students interested in sauna and sauna culture and to maintain and develop the sauna culture in the Otaniemi campus area. We organize joint sauna nights, excursions to public saunas, and other sauna-related events.

Join the warm-hearted company of PTSS! On the [Telegram](https://t.me/PTSSry), you can discuss sauna issues, ask questions on the sauna benches, or hear about upcoming events. Also follow our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ptssry/) page and our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ptss_ry/) channel!

You can join the association by making a [membership application]({{<ref "#join">}}) on the link redirected page. By joining as a member, you can participate in the association's events and get a stylish sauna hat!

Information on the accosiation's overalls badge and sauna hat can be found on the [products]({{<ref "/accessories/index.md">}}) page.

PTSS also collects information about saunas in Otaniemi and its vicinity [saunas]({{<ref "/sauna/index.md">}}). The pages are intended to include a list of all saunas in Otaniemi, the locations and information of the saunas, and a calendar of [Teekkarikylä's general sauna shifts](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=jpv0nr25o8389bl3mao4q3hb9s%40group.calendar.google.com).
